# BrainFuck

**Brainfuck** has to be one of the strangest, most bizzare programming languages I’ve ever stumbled upon. It’s mind-blowing to think that a language with only eight operators `<>+-[],.` could actually be **Turing-complete**! Yet here it is, a minimalist masterpiece that can, with enough patience, produce just about any program you can dream up.

My interest in interpreters and compilers has only fueled my curiosity further, so I set myself a unconventional challenge: to write a Brainfuck interpreter in every programming language I’ve picked up over the years.
